# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

### Updates

Initially I simply added the basic structure of the HTML code and linked the index.css and font files. Then proceeded to work on the header and profile section of the page.  
On the second day I worked on the cards section and on the footer section of the page, finished all the styles and adapted it to work with more responsive designs on different devices.

### Features

So far the project is just the HTML and CSS structure. It is all the appearance of the page. Changing behavior or appearance of buttons on hover and viewing different parts of the
page while also adapting to different screen sizes with media queries.
