# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

### Updates

Initially I simply added the basic structure of the HTML code and linked the index.css and font files. Then proceeded to work on the header and profile section of the page.  
On the second day I worked on the cards section and on the footer section of the page, finished all the styles and adapted it to work with more responsive designs on different devices.

The JavaScript portion of the code actually took longer, especially the part involving form validation, which was harder for me to understand and take in if compared to the basic JS structure of the page. The functions in the index.js file just seemed more straight forward for me, even though I was still able to understand the functions in the validation.js file, the fact that those functions just have more parameters in general make it harder for me to understand.

### Features

Most of the front-end functionality of the page is already done. The user can interact with it, the user can upload new elements to the page with the JavaScript and DOM implementation. The HTML is handling the structure and the CSS the styling of the page.
